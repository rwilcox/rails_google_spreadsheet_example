== An Example of how to use the Google Spreadsheet Ruby gem, with OAuth Login, in a Rails 3 app

This simple example shows how to use the Google Spreadsheet gem, http://github.com/gimite/google-spreadsheet-ruby, to create/write to Google Spreadsheets.

While this is a simple example, it also shows you how to get OAuth up and working with Google services. It also includes a fallback if you want to try this out on your local machine (without going through the mess-that-is-oauth).
